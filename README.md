# trmxclient
Video and image player made with OpenFrameworks for RPi2. All functions of trmxClient are addressable by OSC. 

The code was written by Angela Gabereau (MontrÃ©al) in 2015 for the interactive audiovisual installation "Transmestizx" by Daniela Moreno Wray (http://dmw.hotglue.me/?transmestiza) in Quito, Ecuador. 

The application runs on Raspberry Pi 2 with Archlinux and OpenFrameworks 0.9.3. Thanks to Arturo Castro from OpenFrameworks for support. Instructions for installation > http://openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/raspberry-pi-getting-started-archlinux/

We recommend using Berryboot to install the latest Archlinux on your SSD card http://www.berryterminal.com/doku.php/berryboot

Improvements needed in the code:
1. The media file system needs to recognise alphabetic or numerical order and not change all its media numbers when new media is added at a later letter or number.
2. Currently the internal alpha fade system does not permit rapid (less than 2 or 3 seconds) x-fades.
3. It would be good if Pause, instead of being a toggle, could be distinguished by something like pause 1 pause 0
4. Rename the layers in the order that they are on top of each other - from 1 (bottom) to 4 (top)
