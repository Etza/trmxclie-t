# trmxclient
Video and image player made with OpenFrameworks for RPi2. All functions of TrmxClient are addressable by OSC. The code was written by Angela Gabereau (Montr√©al) in 2015 for the interactive audiovisual installation "Transmestizx" by Daniela Moreno Wray (http://dmw.hotglue.me/?transmestiza) in Quito, Ecuador. In the installation four RPi2 with trmxclient are piloted via OSC from an old macbook running Pure Data.
