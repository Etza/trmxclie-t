# trmxclient
Video and image player made with OpenFrameworks for RPi2. All functions of TrmxClient are addressable by OSC. The code was written by Angela Gabereau (Montr√©al) in 2015 for the interactive audiovisual installation "Transmestizx": four RPi2 with trmxclient orchestrated via OSC from an old macbook running Pure Data.
